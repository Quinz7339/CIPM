# To Refactor/Rename files
1. Change the original file name in <projectname>.pyproject to the new file name.
2. Change the original file name in <projectname>.pyproject.user to the new file name.
As of 13/02/2023, there is no support from QtCreator to automate the refactoring process with a single click. One would need to rename the filenames manually. Refer:
